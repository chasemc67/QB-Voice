So in the intent creation, when you want to put a entity like service in one of your teplates you can so like

@Service:help
or @Service
or repair (where repair is a valid service)

what is the difference?
The difference is the way you can reference them, later in requireds and actions. They pretty much just put a tag on that "version" of service.

in the above case, "help" can be ANY word

It appears as though @Service is "equivalent to" @Service:someUniquEval


if both:
@Service and @Service:help are required, giving an @Service will satisfy an @Service:help too, but not vice versa!
Giving  an @Service:help will NOT satisfy an @Service
