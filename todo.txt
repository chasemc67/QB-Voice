TO DO:

Create entry screen (where invoice isn't selected yet).
from here user can say "create invoice" or "create sales receipt".

Appropriate react component will be loaded (invoice or sales receipt),
and any additional data the user included (to whom? for how much?) should also be captured.

Get add item working.

Create JSON post requests to set up agent intents and entities to handle the above ^
Should be able to do this from a fresh agent without visiting the site


get Mic stuff working
