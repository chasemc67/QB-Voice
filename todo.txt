Handling Queries:
For now, we’ll just handle each as sub-queries. We’ll worry about compound queries afterwards.

Sub Queries:
Create Invoice or Sales receipt
Add “send to” in invoice
add terms in invoice
add any other data fields in invoice
Change and data fields in Invoice that have already been set
Add items to invoice
Create users if they don’t that don’t exist
Create products/services if they don’t exist

Compound Queries:
Choose create invoice and add 1 or more items (Send an Invoice for 12 socks)
Choose create invoice and enter "to" (Send an Invoice to John)
Add “Send to” AND add Item in same query as create invoice (Send an Invoice to John for socks)


Implied Queries:
    Implied queries are way beyond where we're at. But the idea is that a user can tell QB what has happened, and QB will determine the proper action to take. For example:

"I sold John socks"

    From this, QB should figure out that it needs to enter a sales receipt for socks
    QB should also ask followup questions if it is unsure (maybe in some cases it should be an invoice instead).
    QB should also check if the task even needs to be done (maybe some other app has already entered the sale).
