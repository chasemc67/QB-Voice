TO DO:

[+] Create entry screen (where invoice isn't selected yet).
    from here user can say "create invoice" or "create sales receipt".

[+] Appropriate react component will be loaded (invoice or sales receipt),
    and any additional data the user included (to whom? for how much?) should also be captured.

[+] Create .json files for entities and intents

[ ] Get add item working.
    [ ] Setup contexts, and state saving so items can be added to sales receipts and invoices (because right now their a state equivalent to sales receipts and invoices).

    If the contexts can hold variables, then I won't even need to add any javascript to store the variables for the last state (the invoice name and value)

[+] Add some css

[ ] Create Loader to post requests to set up agent intents and entities to handle the above ^
    Should be able to do this from a fresh agent without visiting the site

[ ] Creater updater, to use put requests to update the intents and entities with changes made in code.


[ ] get Mic stuff working (should probably just integrate in the javascript sdk for this)


Find out if we can inject parameters. why? because:
From the homepage screen the user can start an invoice with anywhere from 0 to all required params.
This user will be dropped into a new context/intent/whatever for sending the invoice, and it needs to know what params it already has.
And then from there, the user might leave again to go add an item and then come back, and the sendInvoice intent still needs to know what params it already has.
Perhaps this can be achieved with multiple session ID's (for the add item query). And maybe the homepage thing can doesn't need to switch contexts...

^ after reading up on contexts, it looks like contexts can have parameters attached to them. This, combined with short small intents, should be enough for us.
