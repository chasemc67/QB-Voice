TO DO:

App appears to behave quite stable when only typing queries (api.ai's mic thing must suck).

[+] Fix redundant call to resolveQuery when using mic (using mic handles query, dont need to call handleQuery and do the request ourselves too.)

[ ] Wire up sales receipt action to view
[ ] Wire up the new subQueries
[ ] Get more stablity when using mic

[ ] Get preview rendering working
    [ ] Put preview rendering in modal?

[+] Get delete context call working
[ ] Add mic button, and get sending of mic string working
    [+] Get Mic working
    [ ] Add single toggle button for mic

[ ] Add some CSS. start making this look pretty

[ ] Create Loader to post requests to set up agent intents and entities to handle the above ^
    Should be able to do this from a fresh agent without visiting the site
    [ ] Creater updater, to use put requests to update the intents and entities with changes made in code.

[+] Create config file for session ID and API Keys

[ ] Get all Sub Queries entered and working
[ ] Get first Compound Queries entered and working

Handling Queries:
For now, we’ll just handle each as sub-queries. We’ll worry about compound queries afterwards.

Sub Queries:
[+] Create Invoice or Sales receipt
[+] Add “send to” in invoice
[ ] add terms in invoice
[ ] add any other data fields in invoice
[ ] Change and data fields in Invoice that have already been set
[+] Add items to invoice
[ ] Create users if they don’t that don’t exist
[ ] Create products/services if they don’t exist

Compound Queries:
[+] Choose create invoice and enter "to" (Send an Invoice to John)
[ ] Choose create invoice and add 1 or more items (Send an Invoice for 12 socks)
[ ] Add “Send to” AND add Item in same query as create invoice (Send an Invoice to John for socks)


Implied Queries:
    Implied queries are way beyond where we're at. But the idea is that a user can tell QB what has happened, and QB will determine the proper action to take. For example:

"I sold John socks"

    From this, QB should figure out that it needs to enter a sales receipt for socks
    QB should also ask followup questions if it is unsure (maybe in some cases it should be an invoice instead).
    QB should also check if the task even needs to be done (maybe some other app has already entered the sale).




QB workflows:

C: “Hey QB. hows it going?”
QB: “Almost as good as your sales this week, Chase”
C: “Send an Invoice”
QB: “Ok, to whom should i send this invoice?”
C: “To John”
QB: “Would you like to add any items?”
C: “Add product”
QB: “How many?”
C: “12”
QB: “Add more items? or send it?”
C: “Send it”
QB: “Sending an Invoice to John for 12 products”


C: “Send a Sales Receipt to Nancy”
QB: “What did you sell Nancy?”
C: “12 products”
QB: “Ready to send it?”
C: “Yes”



C: “I sold nancy 12 products”
QB: “has she paid you yet?”
C: “yes, in cash”
QB: “Alright, I’ll send Nancy a sales receipt for 12 products”
